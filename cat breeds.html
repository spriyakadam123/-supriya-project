            <p>Perhaps one of the most distinctive breeds, Siamese cats are most often cream-colored with
                 grey-brown paws and icy blue eyes. Everything about Siamese is a bit pointier than other breeds,
                  from the large, triangular ears to their delicate paws. They’ll often have the same grey-brown coloring on their ears and face. 
                Siamese cats are now bred to come in different colors and patterns. </p>

            <img src="Maine_Coon-1.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Maine Coons have relatively large bodies and lush, heavy coats. They’re muscular, sturdy, 
                and simultaneously regal in stature. Their large eyes, significant paws, and high cheekbones distinguish
                 them from other cat breeds.

                When it comes to personality, these cats toe a line of wanting to be near their humans and needing their 
                own space. They have a reputation for being undeniably attentive and may follow family members around.</p>

            <p> Indie cats are lovable members of different types of families and are known for their courage, intelligence,
                 curiosity, and affection. Indie cats are often adopted from shelters or streets 
                and require a thorough medical check-up before leaving for their forever home.</p>

            <img src="Persian.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Persian cats have stocky bodies with flat, slightly scrunched-looking faces. This is one of the qualities 
                people are often so drawn to, but it can lead to the need for additional medical care. They sport long, soft 
                coats in a variety of colors, including white and black. Though they share some physical characteristics with
                 Maine Coons, they’re often smaller and weigh between 7-12 pounds.

                Despite being sweet with their humans, Persians have a reputation for being slightly standoffish with new people 
                and are considered generally less likely than others to demand attention. Additionally, they can be laid back and
                 mellow relative to other breeds..</p>

            <p>Ragdolls are one of the largest breeds of domestic cats. They are known for their striking blue eyes, 
                semi-longhair coat, and placid temperament. Ragdolls are often referred to as “dog-like cats” because
                 of their tendency to follow people around, 
                their ease at being physically handled, and their relative lack of aggression</p>

                 grey-blue coat, pineapple eyes, and a medium-sized tail. The breed has also been developed in a
