        <h1>Fleas in Dogs</h1>
        <h2>What are Fleas?</h2>
        <p>
            Fleas are very adept at jumping from environment, to host, to pets and people. One female flea can produce up to 50 eggs per day, and the eggs will hatch within 2 to 5 days. The larvae feed and crawl around for up to 2 weeks if the environment is 
            suitable (they love humidity) and then build cocoons in which they pupate into adults. With the right temperature, fully formed fleas can potentially survive in their cocoons for up to 12 months. Eradicating an infestation must be done thoroughly in order to get rid of these pests. A loving and readily available veterinarian can help you successfully
             rid your dog and your home of fleas.
        </p>
        <h2>Symptoms of Fleas in Dogs</h2>
        <p>
            Though some of our canine friends may not have a severe reaction or allergy to fleas, many will be extremely uncomfortable and irritated. Your dog may show the following signs listed here.
            <li>Pruritus (intense itching and licking of the skin)</li>
            <li>There may be additional rubbing and chewing of the skin
            </li>
            <li>Scabbing or redness</li>
            <li>Flea allergic dermatitis (FAD) which is an allergic reaction to the flea saliva</li>
            <li>Hair Loss</li>
            <li>Restless behavior</li>
            <li>Visible evidence of fleas scurrying about, particularly in warm areas (between legs and on the belly)</li>
            <li>Copper colored specks of flea dirt (flea feces to be exact). If you put the specks on a wet paper towel they will turn red; this is digested blood</li>
            <li>Flea dirt can be found on dog bedding also</li>
        </p>
        <h2>Types</h2>
        <p>There are over 2,500 types of fleas worldwide, of which 94% feed on mammals. Four types of fleas found in North America are listed here.</p>
        
        <ul>Ctenocephalides felis</ul> <br> 
        <ol><li>Known as the cat flea</li>
            <li>This is the most common type of flea found on dogs in N.A. So dogs who live in multi-pet households are most at risk for fleas
            </li>
            <li>This is the most widespread type of flea on earth</li>
             <li>Affects rodents, raccoons, rabbits, squirrels, opossums, dogs, cats, humans, and other mammals
             </li>
</ol>
